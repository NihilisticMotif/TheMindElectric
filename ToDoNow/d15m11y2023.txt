Big Idea
1. Simple Data Visualization App
2. Create small simulation projects (widgets) and its documentation
 * Type
 1.1 ML
 1.2 Numerical Method
 * e.g. Neural Network, FFT, Random Forest etc.
2. Tree of Time (inspired by Orange Data Mining App)
3. Convert Image to Tabular data (with the user defined distribution) and/or Matrix

Advice
1. Do small project. Add small features.
2. After the project have ML simulation features, try to compare pros and cons of Excel, Google Sheet, Google Drive, Power Bi and Google Colab.
   Then defined what is the unique purpose of our app.
3. Avoid adding too many feature. I do not want to create data sci general purpose app.
